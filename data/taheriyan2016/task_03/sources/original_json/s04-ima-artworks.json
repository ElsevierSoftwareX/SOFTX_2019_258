Though he was best known as a portrait painter, Brucker also painted regional scenes in both oil and watercolor.  Many of his works combine views from sketches and drawings he made of different sites during different times of the day.  His palette of rich gray tones emphasizes design, composition and line. As a portraitist, Brucker painted Indiana governor Matthew E. Welsh as well as family, friends. He painted several portraits of African Americans, other local citizens and fellow artists.\nMonday Morning is an example of the more modernist idiom Brucker experiments with during the 1940s.  Elements of cubism and a design as precise as an architect’s are present in the painting’s ruler straight lines, angularity, and compressed space.  Like other American artists of the time, Brucker painted back alleys and industrial landscapes, views which seem to capture the stress-filled American society of the 1930s and 1940s.  The bright green spot of vegetation in the center of Brucker’s subdued colors and geometric shapes stands out as a symbol of nature and regeneration amid the urban environment.  Brucker’s inspiration for Monday Morning was a sketch he made on a sunny day in the Little Italy section of Cleveland, Ohio.  Monday Morning was exhibited widely, including, in 1947 at the annual national art competition sponsored by Pepsi-Cola."},{"title":"Still Life","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/still-life-weir-julian-alden","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/e2/e2eef113-36fd-471f-8fed-6ad6e8026ed8.jpg","artist":"Weir, Julian Alden","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1852-1919","creationDate":"1902-1905","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"James E.

Sloan studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where he met Robert Henri, and moved to New York to become a part of Henri’s urban realist circle. Under Henri’s leadership Sloan and seven other artists opposed the traditional hold that that the National Academy of Design had exerted over art in America.  In 1908 the group, which became known as The Eight held an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in New York.  Sloan and four other members of the group painted down-to-earth subject matter which earned them the epithet of Ashcan School, because critics felt their art was offensive. The Ashcan School artists recorded the bustling activity of New York’s lower East Side with broad, vigorous strokes and a conscious avoidance of sentimentality. Sloan taught at the Art Student’s League passing on his style of urban subject matter to Reginald Marsh and Raphael Soyer, who followed in their teacher’s footsteps.\nRed Kimono on the Roof, an unglorified glimpse of a woman, clothespin in mouth, attending to her laundry, may have been painted from Sloan’s studio window, which would explain the elevated vantage point.  The picture’s sense of immediacy and direct observation is enhanced by the spontaneous brushwork and Sloan’s attention to light and shadow.","keywords":{"keyword":["american","ashcanschool","chores","city","cityscape","clothesline","clothespin","gray","johnsloan","laundry","nyc","red","reddress","redkimono","rooftop","rooftops","sloan","urban","woman"]}},{"title":"Portrait of Mrs. Addison C.

Davies was born in Utica, New York and exhibited his talent for painting when he was sixteen.  His family moved to Chicago where he studied at the Art Institute.  He went to New York City and continued his studies at the Art Students League, where he met Robert Henri and George Luks.  As with many of the artists who would later make up the group known as The Eight, Davies began his career as an illustrator.  He discovered his distinctive style of the female nude in a landscape setting around the turn of the twentieth-century.  Symbolic and poetic, these figures were posed in a frieze-like manner against mysteriously dark backgrounds and seemed to have their roots in mythology.  In 1908, Davies joined a group of artists at an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery which established these artists as “The Eight.”  Davies became president of the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced the American public to European avant-garde trends.  While Cubism had a short and minor influence on Davies, he continued to focus on the idyllic figures that were the hallmark of his style.\nMany of Davies’ paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world.

Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.\nRichardson recalled that the site of this painting was the front yard of her family’s home at 4314 North Central in Indianapolis. Yet Richardson’s lush green neighborhood scene transcends any specific place to become a symbol of traditional middle-class America during the 1930s. The yards are large and well tended, and the house across the street, characteristic of the days before air conditioning, has a broad, striped awning.  Girls in dresses play under the streetlight, a watchful mother include din its reassuring glow.  Richardson’s vision of the scene reduces figures, trees, even shadows to simplified geometric forms.  The result is a painting that breathes the essence of a summer evening.  Very little imagination is required to hear the gentle nocturnal sounds of crickets and cicadas.","keywords":{"keyword":["neighborhood","night"]}},{"title":"Preparing for the Matinee","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/preparing-matinee-tarbell-edmund-charles","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/a6/a6c79ecd-100a-4252-8b75-49f54ab6417a.jpg","artist":"Tarbell, Edmund Charles","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1862-1938","creationDate":"1907","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. John G.

Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.  Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.    \nShown in New York in 1886, Wash Day, Bavaria is the first painting Adams sent to America for exhibition.  It may be surprising the artist would have chosen this kind of simple scene from everyday life for his debut.  The the diagonal lines of the grass and clothesline draw the viewer to the woman hanging her laundry.  Although the forms are solidly rendered in the academic tradition, this sunlit canvas is brighter and richer in tonality than the dark scenarios preferred by the Royal Academy.  Adams always favored Wash Day, Bavaria and hung it in a place of prominence in his studio when he returned to Muncie.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/august-sunset-prairie-dell-adams-john-ottis","relatedArtworksTitle":"An August Sunset - Prairie Dell"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/thornberrys-pasture-adams-john-ottis","relatedArtworksTitle":"Thornberry's Pasture"},{"id":"2","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/pleasant-run-tc-steele","relatedArtworksTitle":"Pleasant Run"}]},{"title":"Portrait of Clara Fisher","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-clara-fisher-inman-henry","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/2b/2be6e58e-273f-49da-83a1-ab0315b72356.jpg","artist":"Inman, Henry","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1801-1846","creationDate":"1828","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. John E.

When she was eight years old, her mother took her to Saturday art school.  At sixteen, after the death of her parents, Bobbs went to Paris, where she studied at the Académie Julian.  She returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League.  By the time she came back to Indianapolis to continue her training at the John Herron Art Institute, Bobbs had studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, Kenyon Cox and Frank Vincent DuMond.  She also worked with Charles Webster Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts.  At twenty-eight she married William C. Bobbs, president of the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company, a man twenty-three years her senior. After the death of her husband in 1926, Bobbs went back to Paris and opened a studio.  When she returned to Indianapolis, Bobbs opened a studio and gallery where she painted portraits of local citizens, entrepreneurs, and government leaders. Despite coming from a wealthy family and marrying into wealth, which created a great deal of skepticism regarding her sincerity as an artist, Bobbs proved she was serious by becoming a very successful portrait painter.\nWhen this figure study hung in Bobb’s Indianapolis living room, visitors often mistook it for a self portrait from her youth.  Although the sitter’s hat and cape did belong to the artist, the model was a young woman named Jesseca Penn.  While a student in New York, Bobbs met the Scotswoman who had just come to this country and was looking for work.  Bobbs painted her and then sent her to pose for Robert Henri who was teaching at the Chase School in New York.  The “read-haired model,” as she was later known, became a favorite of Henri and posed for many of his best pictures.  The Japanese screen, a stock motif employed by Bobbs’s teachers in Boston and New York, creates the bright tones that suffuse the picture.  Its vertical and diagonal bamboo stalks echo the lines of the sitter, deftly integrating the figure with the background."},{"title":"Souvenir of the Columbian Exposition","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/souvenir-columbian-exposition-atkinson-jacob","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/94/943efd2c-3c0a-4993-8e60-5ecd169b401a.jpg","artist":"Jacob Atkinson","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1864-1938","creationDate":"1893","materials":"oil on canvas","dimensions":"12 x 16 1/8 in.","creditLine":"James E.

Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the Royal Academy in Munich."},{"title":"After the Shower","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/after-shower-chase-william-merritt","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/18/187ae98a-8254-4541-a233-ba9b982aea6e.jpg","artist":"William Merritt Chase","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1849-1916","creationDate":"about 1885-1889","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"John Herron Fund","accessionNumber":"89.2","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/still-life-fish-chase-william-merritt","relatedArtworksTitle":"Still Life with Fish"}},{"title":"The Valley in the Sea","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/valley-sea-moran-edward","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/21/2184c171-36c4-4b1c-b9bb-429ed59bd3cd.jpg","artist":"Moran, Edward","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1829-1901","creationDate":"1862","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Martha Delzell Memorial Fund","accessionNumber":"70.5","galleryLabel":"This canvas is perhaps the only panoramic underwater scene in 19th-century American art, and it is the aquatic equivalent of a Hudson River School landscape.\nMoran may have been inspired by underwater exploration related to the laying of the first successful telegraph cable in 1858.","provenance":"The piece was first owned by Dr. J.M.

Krannert\n Learn More\nDebt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life.  Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took him to Scotland, but his mentor’s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the “Athenaeum Head” currently on the dollar bill.\nIn this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British portraiture.  The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy’s jacket move the viewer’s eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple, elegant, robe à l’anglaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period.  The woman’s hair is lightly powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure à l'hérisson, or “hedgehog,” in which the hair was cut short in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face. \nReference\nCarrie Rebora Barratt, Ellen Gross Miles.  Gilbert Stuart, New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004.  ISBN-13: 978-1588391247","learnMore":{},"relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/marianne-ashley-walker-stuart-gilbert","relatedArtworksTitle":"Marianne Ashley Walker"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-young-woman-stuart-gilbert","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of a Young Woman"},{"id":"2","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-james-whitcomb-riley-sargent-john-singer","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of James Whitcomb Riley"},{"id":"3","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-young-woman-bell-edward-august","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of a Young Woman"},{"id":"4","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-mrs-addison-c-harris-beaux-cecilia","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Mrs. Addison C.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.\nThe Bloom of the Grape, painted in Vernon, Indiana, in early November 1893 during what Steele called “a glorious autumn,” is the artist’s best-known landscape.  Its title refers to the white gauzy veil, known as “bloom,” covering grapes at harvest time.  Steele wrote to his wife that he had never seen better color, “such dull reads and crimsons and faded yellows and oranges, in juxtaposition with such royal purples.” These rich color harmonies are captured in this painting in a manner that critic Charles F. Browne described as conservatively impressionistic, but not wild.  The luminosity and color harmonies found in Bloom of the Grape exemplify the new approach to landscape painting that would earn Steele national recognition for his modified Impressionist style.","keywords":{"keyword":"path"}},{"title":"Chinese Fishing Village, Monterey Bay, California","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/chinese-fishing-village-monterey-bay-california-brown-bolton-coit","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/7b/7b639720-b20a-4253-8024-fbb5bd6af2f0.jpg","artist":"Brown, Bolton Coit","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1864-1936","creationDate":"1890-1900","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Evans Woollen, Stoughton Fletcher, Mrs. Edward Daniels, Mrs. E.F.

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their culture.  After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief. \nThe IMA collection contains several paintings by George Winter two of which are titled Scene on the Wabash.  Both of these works portray a group of Potawatomi Indians gathered next to the Wabash River.

When his father’s business failed, the family came to Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Académie Colarossi and the Académie Julian.  Prendergast became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and oils depicting bustling crowds.  He is remembered today as one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of Cézanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  Prendergast’s brother Charles was an important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother’s work.\nIn Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester, Prendergast handles this watercolor view of the Massachusetts harbor with typical freedom, wielding thin washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing broad areas of the white paper to figure in the composition.

Luks had a vibrant, sometime raucous, personality that is expressed in his lively portraits and urban subjects.  He joined Robert Henri’s circle in their depictions of city life and became part of the Ashcan School.   He was also a member of the rebellious group known as “The Eight” who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in New York in 1908.  Because Luks was a heavy drinker, he became involved in a barroom brawl that ended in his death.\nNew Year’s Shooter dates from around the first exhibition of The Eight, who had banded together to oppose the rigid formulas of academic painting.  He shared with Robert Henri an energetic brushwork, patterned after the dynamic seventeenth-century Dutch painter Frans Hals.  Luks sympathized with the powerless – immigrants, the poor, children – and was at his best when portraying them.  The colorful palette of New Year’s Shooter is in tune with the gaiety and theatricality of the subject."},{"title":"Portrait of a Boy","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-boy-bellows-george-wesley","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/97/97ce7203-f22d-40f6-a155-1e79fd6cdfbd.jpg","artist":"Bellows, George Wesley","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1882-1925","creationDate":"1921","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of the Friends of American Art","accessionNumber":"34.5","galleryLabel":"This canvas depicts Meredith Hare.  His mother asked for a formal portrait.  Bellows complied, but he also painted this more casual likeness.  Mrs. Hare could not decide between the two, so she took neither.\nBellows was a member of the Ashcan School, whose artists preferred unglamorized images.","learnMore":"George Bellows was born in Columbus, Ohio and attended Ohio State University where he provided illustrations for the school’s student yearbook.  Before graduating, he left Ohio State to study art in New York City where he became a student of Robert Henri at the New York School of Art.  Bellows became associated with Henri’s group which was known as “The Eight” and the Ashcan School.

In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. \nBrook in Summer reflects Cox’s high regard for traditional, pastoral landscapes filled with lush scenery and soft light.  Cox varies the format of the traditional landscape by placing the trees, bushes and fallen branches randomly, as they appear in nature, rather than in an idealized order.  This setting is probably a composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-charles-h-brewer-boy-fishing-dog-cox-jacob","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Charles H.

In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. \nCox’s portrait of Charles H. Brewer hung in his son Charles’s home for fifty-five years before it was offered as a gift to the IMA.  The family recounts that the elder Brewer was about twelve years old when Cox painted him.  According to Brewer’s son, the artist finished the painting in his studio, added the fishing rod and dog, which did not belong to the sitter.  Such attributes, including the imaginary landscape in the background, were common practices in nineteenth century portraiture and served to enhance the sitter’s status or, in this case, add to the image of a childhood.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-alice-lyons-hegler-john-jacob","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Alice Lyons"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-john-washington-love-bates-dewey","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of John Washington Love"},{"id":"2","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-clara-fisher-inman-henry","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Clara Fisher"},{"id":"3","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/eliza-c-ayres-","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Eliza C.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.\nPleasant Run has been called the masterpiece of Steele’s Munich manner.  It was painted within months of the artist’s return from five years of study in Germany, where he became increasingly devoted to painting from nature.  The canvas’s dark tonalities, backlighting, and even its composition, relate to Steele’s scenes of Bavaria.  Yet as the artist noted in his journal, he remained sensitive to the nuances of the Indiana landscape, carefully recording its color contrasts and clear light.  In 1885 when T. C. Steele painted this landscape, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.  The area depicted here was located just north of Irvington at the southwest corner of what is now Arlington and Tenth Street.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/june-idyl-tc-steele","relatedArtworksTitle":"A June Idyl"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/bloom-grape-tc-steele","relatedArtworksTitle":"The Bloom of the Grape"}]},{"title":"Joan of Arc","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/joan-arc-melchers-gari","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/52/52d9ef85-91c2-4730-9382-f57307a684b0.jpg","artist":"Melchers, Gari","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. Albert J.

During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these trips home to sell at exhibitions.  When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.  Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.\nIn 1883 William Forsyth entered the Technical Painting Class of Ludwig von Löfftz, where he received a full grounding the painting of portrait heads and figure studies.  In this canvas painted about midway through his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the woman’s hands and facial features.  Old Market Woman exemplifies the Munich School’s dark tonality and bravura brushwork, derived from the 17th-century Dutch portraits of Rembrandt and Hals.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/crocuses-forsyth-william-j","relatedArtworksTitle":"Crocuses"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/pleasant-run-tc-steele","relatedArtworksTitle":"Pleasant Run"}]},{"title":"Landscape near Dachau","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-near-dachau-currier-joseph-frank","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/ee/eef7d324-7a52-4651-8a50-47fbb58f928f.jpg","artist":"Currier, Joseph Frank","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1843-1909","creationDate":"about 1880","materials":"oil on canvas","dimensions":"18 3/4 x 37 1/2 in.","creditLine":"Miscellaneous Painting Fund","accessionNumber":"1992.361","galleryLabel":"The subdued tones typical of the Munich School are applied with a freedom of execution unusual for the period.\nThis broad landscape exemplifies Currier’s bold, emotional response to the powers of nature.\nCurrier studied in Munich and sometimes painted the dark moors of nearby Dachau.","keywords":{"keyword":"brown"}},{"title":"Concretion","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/concretion-morris-george-lovett-kingsland","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/74/74f43856-ea7b-470d-92a9-ed1bdbf12896.jpg","artist":"Morris, George Lovett Kingsland","creationDate":"1937","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Mr. and Mrs Julius F.

His early use of the family’s walls as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.  When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.  Forsyth started his art studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.  He earned his living painting houses with his brother and used his free time to explore his artistic talents.  Forsyth became the first student in the newly established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.  His desire for more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these trips home to sell at exhibitions.  When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.  Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.\nOhio River Boat is one of Forsyth’s paintings produced for the Public Works of Art Project.  The scene may depict the landing at Madison, Indiana.  Relying on his extensive outdoor painting experience, Forsyth created the intense, humid light of a landscape painted directly from nature.  His animated brushwork belies the fact that he was physically weakened by his heart attack."},{"title":"Plaster Cast of Bronze Bust of Evans Woolen","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/plaster-cast-bronze-bust-evans-woolen-david-k-rubins","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/2d/2d00db8d-10dd-479a-8d62-50e786cea5e8.jpg","artist":"David K.

To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich’s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three.\nThe carefully delineated facial features of this model are in stark contrast to the loose, animated strokes that define his hair and clothes. Richard’s free handling of the paint makes it difficult to differentiate between the man’s attire and his long flowing beard.  While the model’s face exemplifies the perfect outline found in the work of German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dűrer, the rest of the canvas exhibits the influence of the bravura brushwork associated with the 17th-century Dutch painter Franz Hals.  These seemingly opposing influences combined to form the dominant style of the Royal Academy know as Munich realism.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/st-jerome-coqueret-achille","relatedArtworksTitle":"St. Jerome"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/study-head-old-man-richards-samuel-g","relatedArtworksTitle":"Study Head (Old Man)"}]},{"title":"Chief Flat Iron, Sioux","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/chief-flat-iron-sioux-sharp-joseph-henry","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/ba/ba1b3220-e0db-4e0c-b29b-82f491e7b1f7.jpg","artist":"Sharp, Joseph Henry","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1859-1953","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"John Herron Fund","accessionNumber":"03.1","keywords":{"keyword":"nativeamerican"}},{"title":"On The Brandywine","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/brandywine-laer-alexander-theobald-van","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/b3/b3fb8298-7199-4963-9078-ef16f473b4dc.jpg","artist":"Laer, Alexander Theobald van","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1857-1920","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Miss Louise Bybee","accessionNumber":"12.97"},{"title":"Street Scene","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/street-scene-ullman-eugene-paul","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/48/48333144-ce05-4077-a1e6-bba60232899a.jpg","artist":"Ullman, Eugene Paul","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1877-1953","materials":"oil on panel","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. William A.

Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.\nThe young woman in Steele’s canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academy’s preference for older models.  This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background.  The setting and execution exemplify the austere style espoused by Germany’s Royal Academy teachers.  Löfftz was prone to severe criticism of the “sweet color” in his students’ work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/munich-model-tc-steele","relatedArtworksTitle":"The Munich Model"}},{"title":"Scene on the Wabash (near Pipe Creek)","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/scene-wabash-near-pipe-creek-winter-george","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/99/9915d50b-09c9-4009-b440-cc16daf518a6.jpg","artist":"Winter, George","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1810-1876","creationDate":"probably 1840s","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Harvey Elam","accessionNumber":"20.160","galleryLabel":"Here, a group of Potawatomi Indians gather next to the Wabash River.  The figures are posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winter's goal to record the daily life and customs of these people.\nWinter was born in England and came to America in 1830 to study in New York.  In 1837 he moved to Logansport, Indiana.","provenance":"Collection of Judge Biddle, Logansport and John B.

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief. \nWinter’s arrival in Logansport, Indiana, coincided with the last months of the Potawatomi in Indiana.  His ambition to record, with an ethnographer’s attention to detail, the daily life and customs of the Wabash Potawatomi resulted in scores of drawings, made between 1837 and 1838, which served as the basis for Indian paintings such as Scene on the Wabash. The Potawatomi’s contented expressions are at odds with the overall melancholy of the barren landscape.  Winter often included a dead tree in his Potawatomi pictures as a symbol of their removal from native lands.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/scene-wabash-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"Scene on the Wabash"}},{"title":"Monarch Beech","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/monarch-beech-bundy-john-elwood","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/bb/bbac6d3a-de19-491f-a5f2-4365a69efd48.jpg","artist":"Bundy, John Elwood","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1853-1933","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of the Benjamin Harrison School","accessionNumber":"21.99","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/edge-wood-twilight-bundy-john-elwood","relatedArtworksTitle":"On the Edge of the Wood at Twilight"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hanging-moss-st-petersburg-adams-john-ottis","relatedArtworksTitle":"Hanging Moss, St. Petersburg"}]},{"title":"Apache","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/apache-phillips-bert-greer","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/5f/5f67432b-de79-405b-b542-02e0ae2d1a58.jpg","artist":"Phillips, Bert Greer","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1868-1956","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Bequest of Delavan Smith","accessionNumber":"25.100"},{"title":"Study of a Hat","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/study-hat-ketcham-susan-merrill","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/64/64113803-39e6-4c3e-9f91-5387d6c8da44.jpg","artist":"Ketcham, Susan Merrill","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1841-1930","creationDate":"1889","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift to the Art School by Susan M.

He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.  Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.    \nBrookville, just a few miles southwest of Indianapolis, was far removed from the bustle of the city.  Although only a small town in Morgan County, it was easily accessible by railroad.  Local historians do not remember the exact location of Thornberry’s pasture.  In this picturesque view of an autumn afternoon, Adams achieves the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment.  The setting sun leaves the foreground landscape in deep shadow, the grassy terrain dappled with sunlight, and the middle ground fully engulfed in a flowing autumnal light.  Adams uses a vertical canvas to place a strong emphasis on the trees that blanket the blue sky with their orange foliage.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/august-sunset-prairie-dell-adams-john-ottis","relatedArtworksTitle":"An August Sunset - Prairie Dell"}},{"title":"A Young Woman","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/young-woman-metcalf-willard-leroy","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/8a/8abb1bf7-c3db-46be-8afe-8c4715a2cbe3.jpg","artist":"Metcalf, Willard LeRoy","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1858 - 1925-1858 - 1925","creationDate":"1893","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. Wood L.

C.   \nThis small painting of roses is among the most sophisticated works produced in Indiana during the early 1870s.  It displays Hilliard’s fluid brushwork and his subtle control of the contrast of light and dark tonalities.  The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of Japanese design.  Japanese art played a significant role in late nineteenth-century European and American painting."},{"title":"Landscape near Lafayette","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-near-lafayette-winter-george","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/fb/fbd07b07-4be2-46cb-841d-a7e3c1080d14.jpg","artist":"Winter, George","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1810-1876","creationDate":"1850-1876","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Eli Lilly","accessionNumber":"63.257","learnMore":"George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief. \nWinter’s early training in England exposed him to the traditional pastoral, classically inspired landscapes modeled after the work of 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain.  Although this canvas purportedly depicts a view of the Wabash River near Lafayette, the graceful trees that frame the foreground, the measured recession of space, and the warm, dusky light suggest that it is a thoroughly idealized scene. Landscapes that partially transformed the untamed Indiana countryside into an orderly, ideal world probably appealed to Winter’s purchasers.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/little-gem-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"The Little Gem"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/nocturnal-landscape-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"Nocturnal Landscape"},{"id":"2","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/spotted-faun-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"Spotted Faun"},{"id":"3","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-mary-galpin-cole-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Mary Galpin Cole"},{"id":"4","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-albert-cole-winter-george","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Albert Cole"}]},{"title":"Portrait of Joel Barlow","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-joel-barlow-robert-fulton","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/4f/4fec36d3-d798-40c7-8af1-65ef1739046e.jpg","artist":"Robert Fulton","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1765-1815","creationDate":"1805","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Eli Lilly","accessionNumber":"64.30"},{"title":"Late Afternoon, Dachau Moor","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/late-afternoon-dachau-moor-tc-steele","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/81/8128a85f-f2bd-4cf1-b2f6-eeb36fcef2ef.jpg","artist":"T.C.

Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.\nSituated between the German towns of Dachau and Schleissheim, the Dachau Moor was a favorite painting spot for Steele and Forsyth.  It offered a serene landscape where the Hoosier artists could spend undisturbed hours sketching and painting.  Here in the dwindling late afternoon light, Steele captures the essence of the quiet scene.  In this richly r=textured landscape, the thick areas of white suggest reflections from the sun’s descending rays on the rippling water. The sense of solitude is broken only by the two peasant women fathering reeds in the dimly lit landscape.  Painted near the end of his stay in Munich, the dark, gray-green tonality of Late Afternoon is a legacy of Steele’s academic training.","keywords":{"keyword":"marsh"}},{"title":"Portrait of Thomas Lakin","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-thomas-lakin-tc-steele","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/00/00d4de9a-8d7d-4774-b510-bd85f874e086.jpg","artist":"T.C.

Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.  Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.    \nThis study of a half-draped man was probably painted during the two years Adams spent in Professor Löfftz’s Technical Painting Class.  The unidealized figure sits in a dramatically lit interior, animated by contrasts of light and dark.  A thread of light describes the contour of the model and catches in its aura the smallest nuances of hair on the head, chin, chest, arms, and back.  These effects can result only from the closest and most time consuming study.  Such labor was expected of the students in Löfftz’s painting class.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/wash-day-adams-john-ottis","relatedArtworksTitle":"Wash Day"}},{"title":"Hot Sun","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hot-sun-richardson-constance","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/e9/e96c4225-ad9b-41d2-8fb1-cffce8d0c1b6.jpg","artist":"Richardson, Constance","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1905-4-Feb-02","creationDate":"1947","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Kappa Kappa Kappa","accessionNumber":"72.33","learnMore":"Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling during the summer.

Adams’ father encouraged his interest in art.  The first portrait commission the young boy received was a picture of a heifer named “Gypsy Girl III” for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in Italy.  A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri.  Adams’ developed a style of “alla-prima” painting, which means “all at once,” is a method of painting in which the work is completed in one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting.  These rapidly painted works contain energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses, military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  “At one point in his career, Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects. \nIn terms of awards and honors, Adams may be Herron’s most successful alumnus, winning prizes in most of the major national competitions during his 60-year career.  This portrait of the conductor of the Indianapolis Orchestra, Alexander Ernestinoff, won the Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1914 and vaulted Adams into the ranks of the country’s leading portraitists.  The flowing brushwork reveals the influence of Adams’ principal teacher at Herron, William Forsyth, as well as his instruction in New York with the American masters of bravura painting, Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase.  In keeping with Chase and Henri’s method of rapid execution, Adams is reported to have completed the Ernestinoff likeness in just three hours.  According to Adams’ account of the sitting, Ernestinoff came into the studio and casually dropped into a chair, still wearing his hat and overcoat.  The relaxed pose so appealed to Adams’ love of the spontaneous that it became the basis for the portrait.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/josiah-kirby-lilly-jr-adams-wayman","relatedArtworksTitle":"Josiah Kirby Lilly, Jr."}},{"title":"Portrait of Anton Scherrer","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-anton-scherrer-adams-wayman","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/6d/6d0ec338-2647-49c9-a500-95f53d422883.jpg","artist":"Wayman Adams","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1883-1959","creationDate":"1956","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. Wayman Adams","accessionNumber":"60.1","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-dr-t-victor-keene-adams-wayman","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Dr. T.

It descended in the artist’s family, surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store.  When it entered the IMA, the image was marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame.  After treatment in the museum’s laboratory and careful reframing, Chase’s grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture."},{"title":"The Temple of Philae","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/temple-philae-briscoe-franklin-d","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/7c/7c9e2168-4136-45c6-8974-b60a026562ca.jpg","artist":"Briscoe, Franklin D.","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1844-1903","creationDate":"1873-1873","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Margaret C.

Ottis Adams and William Forsyth.  Richard Gruelle had died seven years earlier.\nThe artists are posed as if they were choosing paintings for an art exhibition.","provenance":"Purchased from the artist by a group of local patrons for the museum.","learnMore":"Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and amateur artist. Adams’ father encouraged his interest in art.  The first portrait commission the young boy received was a picture of a heifer named “Gypsy Girl III” for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in Italy.  A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri.  Adams’ developed a style of “alla-prima” painting, which means “all at once,” is a method of painting in which the work is completed in one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting.  These rapidly painted works contain energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses, military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  “At one point in his career, Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects. \nThe Art Jury, which depicts T C. Steele, Otto, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and William Forsyth, the Hoosier Group artists who were Adams’ first teachers in Indiana, exemplifies the Adams’ group portraits.  This realistic view of his mentors shows them judging works of art.  Each portrait is carefully constructed to express the artists’ personalities, demeanor and facial features.  The portrait even shows Forsyth smoking, Stark with a cane and the signature beards worn by the men.  It is one of the few group images of the members of the Hoosier Group that depicts their likenesses with such accuracy. The only missing member, Richard Gruelle, died before the work was painted.\nThe Indianapolis Museum of Art has more than fifty works by Wayman Adams in its American collection.  Many of these are portraits of famous Indiana residents. Included in this group are the author Booth Tarkington, the poet James Whitcomb Riley, the pharmaceutical giant, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., the artist Randolph Coats and the local art dealer Carl Herman Lieber."},{"title":"Morning--Old Schofield's Mill","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/morning-old-schofields-mill-tc-steele","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/0d/0da8ff33-c3f4-4a33-919d-333ab7b66238.jpg","artist":"T.C.

In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. \nCox often modeled his landscapes after the calm, pastoral views of Hudson River school painters, such as Asher B. Durand. Landscape near Indianapolis may depict a stretch of Fall Creek north of the city, an area Cox frequently painted.  The three figures in the lower left could be a family about to begin the arduous transformation from the frontier into the orderly Indiana farmland pictured in the distance.  The bridge in the composition’s center reinforces the idea of transition from wilderness to productive land.  Cox’s soft brushwork and saturated pastel palette convey a sense of optimism about life in Indiana in the 1860s.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/farmyard-scene-cox-jacob","relatedArtworksTitle":"Farmyard Scene"}},{"title":"Young German Girl (Gretchen?)","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/young-german-girl-gretchen-richards-samuel-g","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/fa/faa5ca40-89eb-4bf2-9e2e-5acd85106433.jpg","artist":"Richards, Samuel G.","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1853-1893","creationDate":"1887-1889","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. Samuel Richards","accessionNumber":"29.93","learnMore":"Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that time.

To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich’s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three.\nRichards completed his training at the Royal Academy in 1887, but unlike the other Hoosier artists, he showed no interest in landscape painting or any inclination to return to Indiana in the near future.  Instead, he entered the mainstream of professional figure painting in Munich.  This portrait, presumed to be the artist’s Munich-born daughter Gretchen, epitomizes all the richness of detail and formality associated with Munich realism.  Gretchen is posed in profile against an unadorned background.  Her hair and facial features are executed with exquisite detail.  Richards’ use of dark tonalities is in keeping with his Munich training, but the delicate pink scarf relieves the starkness of the composition."},{"title":"Old Johnnie's Wife","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/old-johnnies-wife-robert-henri","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/56/56430cec-f972-4e53-988d-9387dbe0f41a.jpg","artist":"Robert Henri","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1865-1929","creationDate":"1913","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of John J.

He also taught fine art at the Herron Art School and the Art League.\nHopper painted Blue Monday the same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron.  The painting’s title almost certainly refers to the gloomy mood Hopper achieved in his depiction of a backyard in a rural community at the end of the Depression. Hopper’s use of color powerfully evokes the harsh quality of the scene.  A pale, dead yellow covers the dried grass and weathered buildings, shadows are painted in the brown color of used motor oil, and the sky is a smear of smoky tones.  Echoing the blank faces of the men and women is the blank face of the house in the left background."},{"title":"The Park, Salem","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/park-salem-prendergast-maurice-brazil","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/9e/9e78defc-6a79-4efc-9eda-54187497de36.jpg","artist":"Prendergast, Maurice Brazil","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1859-1934","creationDate":"about 1910","materials":"watercolor over pencil on paper","creditLine":"Gift of the Gamboliers","accessionNumber":"34.16","galleryLabel":"The artist translated the activities of everyday life into a loosely knit tapestry of flat, bold areas of color.\nPrendergast preferred the medium of watercolor.\nThe site for this watercolor is probably a nature park near Salem, Massachusetts.","learnMore":"Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father’s business failed, the family moved to Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Académie Colarossi and the Académie Julian. Whether in Paris, Venice, or Boston, Prendergast was attracted to the vivid parade of everyday life. He became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Until 1904 he worked almost exclusively in watercolor. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and later oils depicting bustling crowds. Prendergast is one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of Cézanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  His brother Charles was an important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother’s work.\nPrendergast translated the bustling activity of busy park scenes or passing crowds into flat, bold areas of percolating color arranged like a loosely knit tapestry of contrasting shapes and forms.  While his technique became progressively decorative, Prendergast’s themes remained consistent.  The site for Park Salem  is believed to be a marine park near Salem, Massachusetts.","relatedArtworks":{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/glimpse-harbor-gloucester-prendergast-maurice-brazil","relatedArtworksTitle":"Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester"}},{"title":"Praying Angel","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/praying-angel-robert-william-davidson","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/8e/8ecae584-d923-45f4-b1de-7e96abd6d6d9.jpg","artist":"Robert W.

In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. \nFarmyard Scene displays an unqualified enthusiasm for the vitality, bounty, and sheer visual appeal of rural life.  Cox continually searched for themes that would appeal to Midwestern patrons, and images of prosperity derived from working the land must have been popular subjects.  The European style of the architecture in Farmyard Scene suggests that Cox was probably inspired by Dutch and English painting.  Perhaps he was striving to elevate the familiar barnyard scenery through associations with Old World culture.  In this canvas Cox gave prominence to the natural beauty and vigor of the animals and relegated the two women and the buildings to the shadowed areas of the scene.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/farmyard-le-pouldu-verkade-jan","relatedArtworksTitle":"Farmyard at Le Pouldu"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/farm-yard-cock-turner-charles-turner-joseph-mallord-william-4","relatedArtworksTitle":"The Farm-Yard with the Cock"},{"id":"2","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/normandy-farmyard-","relatedArtworksTitle":"Normandy Farmyard"}]},{"title":"Portrait of Amelia Studley","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-amelia-studley-easton-joseph","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/c8/c811c569-c94d-4c2c-b686-c7f9c1c0fdf1.jpg","artist":"Easton, Joseph","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1829-1875","creationDate":"about 1865","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Purchase Fund","accessionNumber":"55.67","galleryLabel":"In this portrait Eaton's brushstrokes appear loose, but the drawing of the sitter's facial features remains firm and solid.\nEaton spent only a short time in Indianapolis, during which he studied under Jacob Cox.  He eventually settled in New York.\nThe artist developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women's portraits.","provenance":"Miss Violet G.

Early in his career, Head was a recipient of many art awards including the J. I. Holcomb Prize from the Indianapolis Art Association and the Ross J. Beatty Prize from the Hoosier Salon.  He was one of the artists selected by Wilbur Peat, director of the John Herron Art Institute, to represent Indiana in a nationwide exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D. C. After a short time constructing airplane components during World War II, Head settled into a dual career as a commercial artist and farmer.\nViews of railroad tracks, factories and backs of houses were common subjects for many American painters during the first half of the twentieth-century.  Some artists chose such subjects to portray the social inequities and the grim ugliness that were part of modern urban life.  Although Buildings in Winter depicts an alley in a working-class Indianapolis neighborhood, the artist has stated that he was more interested in achieving a strong composition and rich color scheme than in making a social statement.  Head organized the blocky, geometric shapes of the buildings into a solid triangle, implied by the convergence of the stairs on the left and the slope of the roofs on the right. Buildings in Winter was exhibited at the 1939 New York World’s Fair."},{"title":"Unfinished Landscape (American Lake Scene at Sunset)","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/unfinished-landscape-american-lake-scene-sunset-cole-thomas","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/f7/f76cec30-d95d-4b8f-b392-c3e2c38be84e.jpg","artist":"Cole, Thomas","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1801-1848","creationDate":"about 1845-1847","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Allen Whitehill Clowes Fund","accessionNumber":"1983.68"},{"title":"Landscape","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-wyant-alexander-helwig","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/67/677fb815-fe0c-4231-ae17-380a56d47d9f.jpg","artist":"Wyant, Alexander Helwig","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1836-1892","creationDate":"1878-1878","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"The Ballard Family Memorial Fund","accessionNumber":"1983.96"},{"title":"Strawberries","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/strawberries-hays-barton-stone","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/eb/ebb0a9c6-b9fe-4940-8604-fa323ce24425.jpg","artist":"Hays, Barton Stone","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1826-1914","creationDate":"about 1870","materials":"oil on board","creditLine":"Gift of the Honorable and Mrs. Paul H.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.\nSchliersee, a resort tucked into the Alps thirty-eight rail miles southeast of Munich, was a favorite vacation spot for the Steele family.  From the shores of Schliersee Lake, Steele depicts the picturesque quality of the town.  Framed by sea and sky, the landscape of farms, cottages and churches is echoed in the water’s reflections.  The boat placed to the left of the village provides the necessary balance to complete the carefully constructed composition."},{"title":"On the Edge of the Wood at Twilight","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/edge-wood-twilight-bundy-john-elwood","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/54/54a02548-3b93-46cf-aa57-2bfed63ad787.jpg","artist":"Bundy, John Elwood","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1853-1933","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. J.

Although the genteel setting falls within the tradition of interiors painted by the Boston School artists, the thick, simple strokes used to suggest the visitor’s hands show Wagenhals’ familiarity with bolder painting styles.  The tidy background of straight lines and 90 degree angles reinforces the impression of propriety.  If not for the sitter’s intelligent expression and alert bearing, the door in the background might be interpreted as a symbol of a highly desired departure rather than a welcome arrival.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/woman-seated-armchair-matisse-henri","relatedArtworksTitle":"Woman Seated in an Armchair"},{"id":"1","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-man-glove-corneille-de-lyon","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of a Man with a Glove"}]},{"title":"Portrait of David Cox","sourceURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-david-cox-peale-rembrandt","imageURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/sites/default/files/mercurycache/4_column/mars/81/8154ad17-0378-4ebb-a7f1-1b0095695e08.jpg","nationality":"American","birthDeath":"1778-1860","materials":"oil on canvas","creditLine":"Gift of Mrs. C.

Both artists arrived in Indianapolis in 1876. Bates and Love, along with James Gookins helped establish the first Indiana School of Art in 1877. The school was short-lived and closed after only two years. \nThe friendship between Bates and Love is apparent in the inscription on this portrait which reads, “a mon ami, John Love” (to my friend, John Love).  Bates places his subject in a room that is probably an artist’s studio, possible part of the newly formed Indiana School of Art. The sitter’s casual pose is enhanced by his outdoor attire and posture and the dog that sits beside the chair gazing up at him.","relatedArtworks":[{"id":"0","relatedArtworksURL":"http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/portrait-helen-miller-mrs-charles-g-mclean-peale-rembrandt","relatedArtworksTitle":"Portrait of Helen Miller (Mrs. Charles G.
