<http://subclass_of_thing/This is a brand new Bainter Boom Trencher. Manufactured right here in the USA in Hoxie, Kansas and has a cutting depth of 3 foot 6 inches. We also have two other sizes as well. With an extension kit this trencher can be made to trench at 4 foot 6 inches. With its patented design,  it's the only trencher on the market that trenches in a forward moving direcition . With the increased  safety  of trenching forward, you will never go through the frustration of trenching in reverse again with a Bainter Boom Trencher. Our Skid Steer attachment trencher will work with any brand of Skid Steer. Please visit our website at www.bainterboomtrenchers.com for more information and demo videos. Remember, once you own a Bainter Boom Trencher, you'll never look back. For more information send email to mark.nelson@bainterboomtrenchers.com>
